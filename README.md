Bitmessage Trash
=========

This is a simple program written in Python to remove and read messages from the trash

  - You can read messages from the trash
  - You can completely delete messages from trash
  - You can recover (export) trashed messages to text files
  - This is a version written in one night, anyone can add or change something, just let me know about changes, maybe I'll like :)


What inspired me to create this program? 
No trash and message file occupies _more space_ on disk!

> du -sh messages.dat

> 112M  messages.dat

PyBitmessage has no option for trash management, so when you accidentally move a message to trash, it is effectively lost. With Bitmessage Trash you can re-read and recover those messages.
